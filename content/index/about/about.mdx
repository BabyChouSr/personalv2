Hello! I'm Christopher, a software engineer based in Fremont, CA.

I enjoy designing programs that can enhance the joy of living. I am especially passionate about creating
autonomous robots that can help us do little things from refilling water bottles to exploring the surface of Mars!

I am a freshman at UC Berkeley studying EECS and Business Administration. I am also currently a website development intern at Berkeley's high-tech entrepreneurship accelerator Skydeck and a software & data engineering intern at Experify. On my free time, I enjoy competing
in Taekwondo, watching MMA, and listening to songs (favorite artist: The Kid LAROI).
