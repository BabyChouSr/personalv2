Hello! I'm Christopher, a software engineer based in Fremont, CA.

I enjoy designing programs that can enhance the joy of living. I am especially passionate about creating 
applications that allow us to live healthier and more productive lives.

I'm studying EECS and Business Administration at UC Berkeley. I'm also a website development intern at Berkeley's high-tech accelerator Skydeck and a software & data engineering intern at Experify. On my free time, I enjoy competing
in Taekwondo, watching MMA, and listening to songs (favorite artist: The Kid LAROI).
